# Bremen.io

Back when we started our second proyect in Ironhack, I set out not to build something, but rather, to redesign a product I had used in the past, but I had found lacking as a user: a website or app that serves as a 'bonfire for bards to gather around', a meeting spot for musicians to find new projects to join, or to announce their own projects and seek new members who want to join them.<br><br>
The name of this idea, <b>'Bremen'</b>, takes its name from the German fable of The Musicians of Bremen, a tale abour four farm animals who meet in unusual circumstances and decide to come together as a band to play all over the country.
